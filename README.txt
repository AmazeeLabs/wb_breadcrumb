Created from ground up without knowledge Drupal 7 )))
This module different from https://www.drupal.org/project/menu_breadcrumb
because this module can create breadcrumbs from menu title not from node title so wb_breadcrumbs create breadcrumbs from any link type. All what module need created menu tree.

How to use

Create new menu or use default Drupal's menu
After module installation navigate to Configuration->System->Breadcrumbs configuration and type your menu name there
Default name there is "category".
